My work on plane detection and object alignment in 3d scenes made it into IEEE ICMEW.

Working for ETH's Media Technology Center, I contributed to the paper [Simplifying the Process of Creating Augmented Outdoor Scenes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9106030) published in IEEE ICMEW. The goal of the project was a system to augment models of outdoor spaces with virtual objects and then see it in the actual location with an AR device. My work on plane detection was used to fine-tune the object placement on the AR devices, so that objects are precisely aligned with the real world.
