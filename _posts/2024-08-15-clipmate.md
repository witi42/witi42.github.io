Main developer of [Clipmate](https://clipmate.ai/), an AI bookmark manager.

Together with my co-founder Moritz, I've been working on Clipmate for half a year. Our main motivation was the struggle to find what we were looking for among thousands of Twitter bookmarks, web links, and screenshots. We started with an [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clipmate-bookmark-like-a-pro/id6480199885) but are now focussing on a web app that syncs and organizes all of your content.
